# Setup
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Use Intellij. The information in this README assumes you are using IntelliJ. it does not matter if you have IntelliJ ultimate.

Must have Java 17 installed and set in project. To do so:
```
file > Project Structure > Project > SDK
```
Also set the Language level to SDK default. If you have OpenJDK 17 from Oracle, use that. Else, you can download Amazon Corretto 17.0.13 from Intellij Directly if you click Download JDK in SDK
